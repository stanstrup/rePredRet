Description: Predicts retention times (RTs) by directly mapping between
    chromatographic systems using monotonically constrained GAMs. This is a
    reimplementation of PredRet that uses RepoRT data as input and publishes
    predictions to GitHub. Unlike QSRR models that use molecular descriptors,
    rePredRet uses experimentally measured RTs from one system to predict RTs
    in another system.
